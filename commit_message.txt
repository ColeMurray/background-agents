feat(linear): session-level link to existing Linear issue + bridge state.raw for TodoWrite

Session-level "Link to Linear":
- Control plane: POST /sessions/:id/linear/link-session, handleLinearLinkSession in DO;
  updates session.linear_issue_id/linear_team_id, broadcasts session_state_patch
- Router: handleLinearLinkSession, forward only present body keys
- Types: session_state_patch ServerMessage with patch.linearIssueId/linearTeamId
- Web: POST /api/sessions/[id]/linear/link-session, linkSessionToLinear() in lib/linear
- use-session-socket: handle session_state_patch and merge into sessionState
- Metadata section: "Link to Linear" when unlinked; when linked show link + Change/Unlink,
  LinkSessionToLinearModal (team → issue picker → link). Pass sessionId into MetadataSection.
- Docs: LINEAR_INTEGRATION_PLAN testing steps updated (session link first, then task-level)

Bridge TodoWrite / tool_call:
- modal-infra bridge: when state.input is empty, use state.raw as tool args (dict or
  JSON string). OpenCode sends first part update with status=pending and args in state.raw.
- Log has_todos and part_keys/state_keys when skipping for debugging.

Docs:
- Troubleshooting: "Tasks section never appears" with Modal logs and what to look for.
